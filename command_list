Cube rotations:

F (front): the face facing the solver.
B (back): the back face.
R (right): the right face.
L (left): the left face.
U (up): the upper face.
D (down): the face opposite to the upper face.
M (middle): the middle layer parallel to the R & L faces.
E (equator): the middle layer parallel to the U & D faces.
S (side): the middle layer parallel to the F & B faces.

The letter means turning a single turn, (90°), clockwise, the corresponding face.

Letter followed by an apostrophe mark (') means turning the corresponding face a single turn, (90°), counter-clockwise.
ex. R' U'

Letter followed by "2" means turning the corresponding face 2 single turns (180°)
ex. R2 = R R

Command can be written with or without delimitters
ex. RURU = R U R U = R_U_R_U

Cube Rotations
These are not actual turns, and is meant to instruct a rotation of whole the cube.
There are 3 possible axes to rotate the cube on: The X, Y & Z axes.
x : rotating the cube on the X axis. (R & L faces remain intact)
y : rotating the cube on the Y axis. (U & D faces remain intact)
z : rotating the cube on the Z axis. (F & B faces remain intact)

any characters EXCEPT [FBRLUDMxyz'2] will be ignored
